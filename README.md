# Baymax-API
This repository contains the backend (API) application of Baymax. The project is written in **NodeJS**. This API is currently deployed on AWS provided EC2 machine.

## Project Description
Baymax is a solution developed under 36 hours during a hackathon conducted by Google Developers Group VIT, to help diagnose numerous diseases using Apriori algorithm and an interactive mobile application.

The interface essentially takes 5 symptoms as input from the user via a beautifully crafted UI, and returns the probability of several diseases mapped to the sent inputs.
